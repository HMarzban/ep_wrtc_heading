# ep_wrtc_heading

Video Headings Plugin for Etherpad.

WebRTC video/audio, a dedicated chat room for each headlines (h tags).

> Note: for better expriance use [ep_heading2](https://github.com/ether/ep_headings2), [ep_profile_modal](https://github.com/samirsayyad/ep_profile_modal)

## Installing

```bash
$ npm install ep_wrtc_heading
```

## Settings

To set a custom stun server, set ep_wrtc_heading.iceServer in your settings.json:

```json
"ep_wrtc_heading" : {
    "iceServers":[
        {"url": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"}
    ]
}
```

To ensure reliable connectivity we recommend setting both a STUN and TURN server. We don't set this by default and below are just example servers, you should ensure you use reliable STUN and TURN servers.

```json
"ep_wrtc_heading" : {
  "iceServers":[
    {
      "urls": [ "stun:216.246.6.224:3478", "stun:74.125.140.127:19302", "stun:[2a00:1450:400c:c08::7f]:19302" ]
    }
      ,
    {
      "urls": [ "turn:numb.viagenie.ca" ],
      "credential": "muazkh",
      "username": "webrtc@live.com"
    },
    {
      "urls": ["turn:192.158.29.39:3478?transport=udp"],
      "credential": "JZEOEt2V3Qb0y27GRntt2u2PAYA=",
      "username": "28224511:1379330808"
    }

    ],
}
```

To set a custom small and/or large size in pixels, for the video displays, set one or both of the following in your settings.json:

```json
"ep_wrtc_heading": {
  "video": {
    "sizes": {
      "small": 200,
      "large": 400
    }
  }
}
```

To set Limitation for video-chat room:

```json
"ep_wrtc_heading": {
  "videoChatLimit": 4 // default
}
```

## Metrics

You can see metrics for various errors that users have when attempting to connect their camera/microphone:

- `ep_webrtc_err_Hardware`: Some sort of hardware-related connection problem on the users' computer.
- `ep_webrtc_err_NotFound`: Could not find user's camera/microphone.
- `ep_webrtc_err_Abort`: Some sort of other, non-hardware related connection problem on the user's computer.
- `ep_webrtc_err_NotSupported`: User's environment does not support webrtc.
- `ep_webrtc_err_Permission`: User did not grant permission to their camera/microphone
- `ep_webrtc_err_SecureConnection`: Etherpad is not set up on a secure connection, which is requried for webrtc
- `ep_webrtc_err_Unknown`: Some other unspecified error. Perhaps a bug in this plugin.

## changelog

### [v0.27.0]

- Brought up the Gulp, to organize and speed up development workflow.
- Create the Gulp tasks for development and production flow.
- Priority of loading js file, to avoid loss of variable allocation.
- Minify and concat js files.
- If webrtc "failed to configure sdp remote response", the system now tries 10 times to reconnect and establish a stable connection between peers.

### [v0.28.0]

- Leaving the user now happens immediately, the video interface is removed immediately. and make sure that if the main socket is inactive, a leaving will occur.
- The `findTags` features is optimized.
- Fixed audio change, in case of changing audio, there was a problem that the audio source does not change properly.
- You can now set the video codec from the Etherpad settings. by defualt we set `vp9` for video and `opus` for audio.
- Bandwidth usage for video and audio is now limited. audio `50kbits min`, video `128kbits min/max`

### [v0.28.3]

- Added a new modal to display peer-to-peer video/audio realTime information, use [`getStats.js`](https://github.com/muaz-khan/getStats)
- Fixed reconnecting attempts, reset retry counting happening when we have a successful connection to the other peers
- Fixed bandwidth limit, this was an issue where bandwidth usage was not locked at "128 kbps".

### [v0.28.9]
- Fixed copy and paste functionality, this feature was lost during bundling
- Increase bandwidth cap and decrease and lock down video resolution to `QVGA` (`width: {exact: 320}, height: {exact: 240}`)
- Adjust reconnection process, increase the effort to 50 times, and delay cap between `200` to `1000` milliseconds
- Fixed header icon, the video icon did not display when the header was removed or then replaced with new content.
- A spinner is added when the user is waiting to join the room.
- Css adjustment, fixed misalignment(video and inline avatar icons)
- `inlineAvatars` now are clickable, and use the [ep_profile_modal](https://github.com/samirsayyad/ep_profile_modal) model to display user information.

### [v0.30.0]
- Full mesh network for Webrtc, set up and create queues for more stable handshake strategy. (beta-0)
